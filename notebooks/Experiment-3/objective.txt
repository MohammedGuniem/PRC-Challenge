- Best RMSE: 3565 - Grid Search and Evaluate XGBoost model based on encoded_challenge_set
- Best RMSE: 5438 - Try techniques \PCA to improve model performance
- Gather stats from trajectory, merge with challange_set and build model with them, then perform Grid Search and Evaluate

- Try techniques like clustering (k-means) to improve model performance
- Try techniques like categorizing the training data based on error of each datapoint
